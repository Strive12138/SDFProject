First and foremost, I would like to thank Dr Hamish Carr, who provided valuable knowledge of geometry processing in the past year. During the process of this project, his suggestions helped me to achieve the targets correctly and quickly. I also want to thank Dr He Wang and Professor Markus Billeter for supporting and providing straightforward and valuable advice to me on academic writing.
