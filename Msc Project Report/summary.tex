In recent years, signed distance field (SDF) technology has developed in the computer graphic industry. The value of this technology has been proven in many fields, including ray-marching, soft shadow and collision detection. Besides, SDF has been applied to successful commercial game engines like Unreal and film special effects software like Houdini. 

\hspace*{\fill}

This project aims to implement an application which generates the SDF for 3D models through modern Graphic API. The understanding of SDF will be acquired and enhanced during the implementation process. This report covers a brief introduction of SDF, the reason for chosen technologies and the details of implementation and evaluation, which is vital for explaining existing functionality and possible future software refactoring.
